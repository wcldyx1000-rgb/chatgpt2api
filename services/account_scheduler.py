"""Weighted fair scheduling for Upstream Account selection.

Stride scheduling: every account carries a virtual "pass". Picking an account
advances its pass by ``1 / weight``, and the next pick takes the smallest pass,
so over time each account is chosen in proportion to its weight while picks
stay interleaved instead of draining one account in a burst.

Each pool (one set of selection filters) keeps a virtual clock equal to the
smallest pass among its members. The clock is computed over every ready member,
including accounts that are busy or excluded from this particular pick, so a
heavily weighted account that is momentarily at its concurrency cap keeps its
credit. Accounts that rejoin the pool, or are new to it, start at the clock and
cannot bank credit while they were away.

The scheduler is runtime-only state. Callers serialize access with their own
lock; nothing here is persisted, and a restart simply starts a fresh rotation.
